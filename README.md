# Retails- Project
Retail Assess Sales Outlets Performance

In this project I will try to assess the performance of the chain's sales outlets. I will first carry out exploratory data analysis then assess the performance of the sales outlets and finally test statistical hypotheses. I will also add a representation of my work to put my conclusion clear to everyone.

In this repositorie you can found:
<ul>
<li> Notebook including all the work of my project and a Dashboard link </li>
<li> A presentation with some important conclusion </li>
</ul>
